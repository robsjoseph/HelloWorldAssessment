HelloWorldAssessment
====================
Rob Joseph
Project solution in response to the HelloWorld interview assessment.
This is a PHP/MySQL page that performs some basic form entry. It simply captures all users fields, and displays in a table on the 
separate page.

Registration.php
This page is the user entry form, that is submitted with all required fields. This performs some client side validation, using the pattern attribute.

Confirmation.php
This page will do the server side validation, and insert the row into the database. When successful, the user is notified.

Report.php
This displays all users registered, in order by date of entry.

Users.sql
This is the MySQL statement that creates the database used for this project.
